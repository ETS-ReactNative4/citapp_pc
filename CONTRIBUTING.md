# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owner of this repository before making a change.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure the syle of your code is consistent with that of the current one (indentation, etc.).
4. If you've changed any relevant functionalities, update the README.md.
5. Ensure the application is working correctly. The _dev\_test()_ function should pass without issues (see under _Testing and example usage_ in the [README.md](https://github.com/gasparl/citapp_pc/blob/master/README.md "README"). This function is also automatically executed on each git push (as _npm test_; executing _dev\_test()_, _dev\_test(1)_, and _dev\_test(2)_) via Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/gasparl/citapp_pc
6. Issue that pull request.
